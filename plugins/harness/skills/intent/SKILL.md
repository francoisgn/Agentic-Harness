name: intent
description: Turns a request (message, note, idea) into an issue an agent can work from (user story, error behaviours, definition of done, testable acceptance criteria, axis labels), following the agentic-harness harness. Use before any work that does not yet have a clear issue.
argument-hint: "<request in one sentence>"

# Define the intent

Request: $ARGUMENTS. Reference: `.harness/docs/METHODOLOGY.md` §2 (otherwise `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/METHODOLOGY.md`).

1. **Duplicates** first: issues and PRs, open and closed. One exists → complete it rather than create another.
2. Write, in the project's language:
   - `### Summary`: "As <who>, I want <X> to do <Y>, so that <benefit>";
   - `### Error behaviours`: each invalid input, external failure, limit, with the expected result (message, code,
     state kept); "none" must be justified;
   - `### Acceptance criteria`: Given / When / Then, each verifiable by a test;
   - `### Definition of done`: tests (written first, seen red), docs updated, review by another model, compliance if
     the scope requires it, what will be validated on the device;
   - `### Out of scope` and `### Sources` (nothing guessed).
3. Labels: type, priority, difficulty, status; `status: needs-decision` + the exact question if a product decision is
   missing.
4. **Show the text to the operator before creating the issue**; after approval, create it and give the link.
